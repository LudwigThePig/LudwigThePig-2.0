# Ludwig The Pig

This repo is the source code for my portfolio site. I decided to rebuild it from the ground up after graduating from Hack Reactor. While I was at Hack Reactor, I developed a lot of skills that I wanted to employ in here. There are a few major departures in this version of LudwigThePig.com.

First, this is no longer a sales pitch. In the old version of LudwigThePig, a lot of the content was centered around trying to sell my skills to potential future employers. Any sales work will be left at the cover letter. This is no longer my website, it is *Ludwig's* website.

The website will still display all of my projects, list my skills, and have ways to connect, but that is the focus will be on fun features and interesting projects.

Second, this site is written in TypeScript! There is a lot of cool technology baked into this site (you can find a comprehensive list [below](#Technologies)). The intention is to build a platform that can expand easily, although, it may be the case that some of the technology is overkill for this application. Surely this could have been build with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
